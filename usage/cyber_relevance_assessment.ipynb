    "\n",
    "**Test Mode** (`TEST_MODE = True`):\n",
    "- Runs on first 5 countries only\n",
    "- Quick validation of setup and functionality\n",
    "- Generates `ministry_ministry_cyber_test.*` output files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full Mode** (`TEST_MODE = False`):\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **âœ… Script Integration**: Uses the `cyber_relevance_assessment.py` script as an importable module\n",
    "2. **âœ… Dataset Loading**: Loads the ministry ministries dataset with 193 countries\n",
    "3. **âœ… Structured Assessment**: Uses Pydantic models for reliable data extraction\n",
    "4. **âœ… Unified Code**: Same assessment code for both test and full modes, controlled by `max_queries`\n",
    "5. **âœ… Results Processing**: Expands structured data into analyzable columns\n",
    "6. **âœ… Multiple Output Formats**: Saves results in JSON, JSONL, and CSV formats\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Columns Extracted:\n",
    "- `country`: Country name\n",
    "- `domain`: Ministry domain (\"ministry\")\n",
    "- `research_question`: The assessment question asked\n",
    "- `enriched_citations`: Citations with metadata\n",
    "- `relevance_level`: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NONE cybersecurity involvement\n",
    "- `confidence`: Assessment confidence level\n",
    "- `explanation`: Detailed explanation with citations\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Run Full Assessment:\n",
    "1. Change `TEST_MODE = False` in the second cell\n",
    "2. Run all cells - the same code will automatically handle the full dataset"
