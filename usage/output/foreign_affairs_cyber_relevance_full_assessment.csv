foreign_affairs,Afghanistan,low,medium,"According to Afghanistan's 2014 National Cybersecurity Strategy, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT), specifically its Information Systems Security Directorate, is designated to coordinate all cybersecurity and information security issues in the country. This suggests that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not a primary or direct stakeholder in cybersecurity responsibilities[1]. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs typically focuses on international relations and diplomatic activities rather than direct cybersecurity management. However, given that foreign affairs ministries often handle international security cooperation and diplomatic relations, they may have a limited indirect role in cybersecurity aspects such as international collaboration or policy dialogue, but this involvement is secondary and not operational. There is no explicit evidence from the available documents that Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a direct or significant role in the country's cybersecurity management or infrastructure. Therefore, the assessment is that its cyber involvement is low with medium confidence due to the lack of direct references but logical inference about typical ministerial functions[1][2].","Is the department/ministry of foreign_affairs in Afghanistan a direct stakeholder (i.e., responsible for or involved in) the country's cybersecurity?","[{'url': 'https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/National_Strategies_Repository/Afghanistan_2014_National%20Cybersecurity%20Strategy%20of%20Afghanistan%20(November2014).pdf', 'title': '[PDF] National Cyber Security Strategy of Afghanistan (NCSA) - ITU', 'snippet': 'a) MCIT will engage and coordinate training and capacity building programs with donor communities (World Bank, ITU, USAID) to secure funds for information ...', 'date': None, 'last_updated': '2024-02-07', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/cyber-in-afghanistan-techs-vital-role-in-kabul-evacuation', 'title': ""Cyber in Afghanistan: Tech's Vital Role in Kabul Evacuation - GovTech"", 'snippet': 'What is a clear trend across all of these Afghanistan stories is the vital role that cybersecurity and technology are now playing in Kabul.', 'date': '2021-08-22', 'last_updated': '2025-09-15', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/08/internet-under-attack/03-internet-resilience-afghanistan', 'title': 'The internet under attack | 03 Internet resilience in Afghanistan', 'snippet': 'The paper draws on two case studies for key insights on elements of internet resilience such as digital infrastructure, conflict dynamics and policy priorities.', 'date': '2024-08-23', 'last_updated': '2025-02-13', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://merics.org/en/merics-briefs/afghanistan-common-prosperity-data-protection-law', 'title': 'Afghanistan + ""Common prosperity"" + Data protection law | Merics', 'snippet': 'Companies in relevant industries will be required to set up “operators” to coordinate their cybersecurity responsibilities and obligations with ...', 'date': '2021-09-01', 'last_updated': '2025-09-15', 'matched': True}]","[1] **[PDF] National Cyber Security Strategy of Afghanistan (NCSA) - ITU**

DFAT's role is focused on policy, diplomatic engagement, and international cooperation aspects of cyber issues rather than direct operational cybersecurity activities within Australia. The operational leadership and incident response in cybersecurity are principally conducted by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and the Department of Home Affairs, which manage cyber security advice, threat responses, and regulatory frameworks domestically[1][2].

foreign_affairs,Brazil,medium,high,"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in Brazil plays a significant role in the country's cybersecurity, particularly in the realm of cyber diplomacy and international engagement on cyber issues. Brazil employs a decentralized approach to cybersecurity that involves coordination across multiple departments, including the MFA, the Institutional Security Office of the Presidency (GSI/PR), and military cyber commands[1]. The MFA has designated a dedicated cyber diplomat since 2019, responsible for international peace, security, and defense-related cyber affairs, and also a 'tech envoy' for engagement with technology companies[1][2]. Brazil's MFA actively participates in international negotiations and forums on cybersecurity and has represented Brazil in UN processes on cyber governance, such as chairing two UN Groups of Governmental Experts (UNGGE)[2]. However, primary responsibility for national cybersecurity policy development, cyber defense, and operational cybersecurity appears to rest more with the GSI/PR and military bodies[1][4]. Thus, while the MFA is directly involved in cybersecurity in its diplomatic and strategic international dimensions, it is not the lead agency for domestic cybersecurity operations or policy enforcement, which moderates its stakeholder relevance status to medium[1][4].","Is the department/ministry of foreign_affairs in Brazil a direct stakeholder (i.e., responsible for or involved in) the country's cybersecurity?","[{'url': 'https://eucyberdirect.eu/blog/unpacking-brazil-s-cyber-diplomacy', 'title': ""Unpacking Brazil's Cyber Diplomacy"", 'snippet': 'In Brazil, cybersecurity relies on coordination across multiple departments within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) as well as the wider ...', 'date': '2022-03-14', 'last_updated': '2025-08-29', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.lse.ac.uk/ideas/Assets/Documents/project-docs/digital-ir/commentary/LSE-IDEAS-Cyber-Diplomat.pdf', 'title': ""[PDF] A Conversation with Brazil's Cyber Diplomat | LSE"", 'snippet': 'He has worked in multiple thematic areas such as national defence, nuclear diplomacy, and cybersecurity.

foreign_affairs,Switzerland,medium,high,"The Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) plays a significant role in international cyber diplomacy and the promotion of responsible state behavior in cyberspace through initiatives like the Geneva Dialogue on Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace, which it leads. This dialogue fosters global cooperation on cyber norms and confidence-building measures, demonstrating the FDFA's involvement in shaping Switzerland's cybersecurity policy at an international level[4][5][6]. Moreover, the FDFA organizes events to strengthen the cyber-resilience of international organizations and NGOs in Geneva, highlighting an operational role in cybersecurity awareness and capacity building[3]. However, the primary operational and defensive cybersecurity roles in Switzerland rest with other federal bodies such as the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports (DDPS), which includes the National Cyber Security Centre and specialized units responsible for cyber defense and incident response, indicating the FDFA's role is more strategic and diplomatic rather than direct operational cybersecurity management[1][2]. Therefore, the FDFA is a direct stakeholder in Switzerland's cybersecurity landscape, primarily in a policy, diplomatic, and coordination capacity, but not as a frontline operational authority.","Is the department/ministry of foreign_affairs in Switzerland a direct stakeholder (i.e., responsible for or involved in) the country's cybersecurity?","[{'url': 'https://isij.eu/system/files/download-count/2023-01/19.1.06_cybersecurity_switzerland.pdf', 'title': '[PDF] Challenges and the Way Forward for the Swiss Armed Forces - isij.eu', 'snippet': 'With the new law, the FIS has the legal basis to conduct offensive cyber countermeasures against infrastruc- tures located outside Switzerland after ...', 'date': None, 'last_updated': '2025-09-04', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://practiceguides.chambers.com/practice-guides/cybersecurity-2025/switzerland/trends-and-developments', 'title': 'Cybersecurity 2025 - Switzerland - Global Practice Guides', 'snippet': 'While the FADP applies to personal data only and, as noted, is fairly high-level, the Swiss Federal Council enacted the Information Security Act ...', 'date': '2025-03-13', 'last_updated': '2025-09-05', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.eda.admin.ch/missions/mission-onu-geneve/en/home/manual-regime-privileges-and-immunities/cybersecurite.html', 'title': 'Cybersecurity', 'snippet': ""Switzerland's key cybersecurity strengths are in the areas of politics and strategy, as well as in its legal and regulatory frameworks."", 'date': '2024-01-11', 'last_updated': '2025-07-14', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.giplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Geneva-Dialogue-Factsheet.pdf', 'title': '[PDF] Geneva Dialogue on Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace', 'snippet': '- Contribute to achieving the vision of an open, secure, stable, accessible, and peaceful cyberspace, and reduce the risks to international peace and security ...', 'date': None, 'last_updated': '2025-05-06', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://genevadialogue.ch', 'title': 'Geneva Dialogue', 'snippet': 'The Geneva Dialogue facilitates an inclusive global dialogue in promoting responsible behaviour in cyberspace and implementing existing cyber norms.', 'date': '2025-09-09', 'last_updated': '2025-09-13', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.diplomacy.edu/project/geneva-dialogue/', 'title': 'Geneva Dialogue - Diplo', 'snippet': 'The Geneva Dialogue focuses on promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace for international peace and security.

The key entities responsible for cybersecurity policy, implementation, and incident response are the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications (MinTIC), the Ministry of National Defense, and the Superintendent of Industry and Commerce (SIC), not the Ministry of Foreign Affairs[2][5]. Detailed reports on Colombia’s cybersecurity framework, including institutional responsibilities and coordination mechanisms, make no mention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a primary actor[1][2]. The Ministry of Defense is explicitly tasked with developing inventories of critical cyber infrastructure and coordinating with sectors essential to cybersecurity governance[2][3].

foreign_affairs,Cyprus,medium,high,"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Cyprus is a formal, but indirect, stakeholder in the country's cybersecurity landscape. It has a seat on the high-level National Cybersecurity Council, which is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the national cybersecurity strategy and is convened during major cybersecurity crises at the national level[1]. The Ministry's specific role, as outlined in official strategy documents, is international cooperation—reflecting its mandate to coordinate Cyprus’s participation in international cybersecurity initiatives and partnerships, rather than direct operational responsibility for cybersecurity[1]. The main coordination and implementation of cybersecurity policy is led by the Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy, supported by the Digital Security Authority[1][2].

foreign_affairs,Japan,medium,high,"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Japan is involved in cybersecurity particularly from an international relations and diplomatic perspective but is not the primary operational authority for Japan's cybersecurity policy and defense. Japan's core cybersecurity responsibilities mainly reside within agencies such as the Cabinet Secretariat’s Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters, the National Security Secretariat, the Self-Defense Forces, and the National Police Agency, as well as the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) under the Cabinet Office[1][3][4]. The MOFA plays a significant role in coordinating international cybersecurity cooperation, diplomacy related to cyberspace norms, treaties, and alliances, which are critical aspects of Japan's comprehensive cybersecurity strategy involving foreign collaboration and cyber diplomacy. However, it is not directly responsible for operational cyber defense or domestic cybersecurity enforcement, which are handled by other specialized government entities[3][5]. Therefore, the MOFA is a medium-level stakeholder in Japan's cybersecurity, focused mainly on external and diplomatic matters rather than direct operational responsibilities.","Is the department/ministry of foreign_affairs in Japan a direct stakeholder (i.e., responsible for or involved in) the country's cybersecurity?","[{'url': 'https://www.csis.org/analysis/norms-new-technological-domains-whats-next-japan-and-united-states-cyberspace', 'title': ""Norms in New Technological Domains: What's Next for Japan ... - CSIS"", 'snippet': ""The new organization will act as the quarterback for Japan's cybersecurity by leading government efforts and advancing cyber capabilities in ..."", 'date': '2025-06-17', 'last_updated': '2025-09-15', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://therecord.media/japan-enacts-new-law-allowing-offensive-cyber-operations', 'title': 'Japan enacts new Active Cyberdefense Law allowing for offensive ...', 'snippet': ""Japan on Friday enacted a new law that would permit the country's authorities to preemptively engage with adversaries through offensive cyber operations."", 'date': '2025-05-16', 'last_updated': '2025-05-16', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.nisc.go.jp/eng/pdf/cs-senryaku2021-gaiyou-en.pdf', 'title': ""[PDF] Japan's Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 （Overview) - NISC"", 'snippet': 'Support stakeholders who possess personal information and intellectual property. ○ Ensure trustworthiness of IT systems and services from the perspective of ...', 'date': None, 'last_updated': '2025-09-12', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3677/en', 'title': 'The Basic Act on Cybersecurity - English - Japanese Law Translation', 'snippet': 'Article 4The national government is responsible for formulating and implementing comprehensive cybersecurity policies in line with the basic principles in the ...', 'date': '2024-11-13', 'last_updated': '2025-09-15', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://practiceguides.chambers.com/practice-guides/cybersecurity-2025/japan', 'title': 'Cybersecurity 2025 - Japan - Global Practice Guides', 'snippet': 'The Basic Act on Cybersecurity regulates the responsibility of the national government and local governments for cybersecurity (Articles 4 and 5) ...', 'date': '2025-03-13', 'last_updated': '2025-08-29', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.kas.de/documents/d/japan/22', 'title': ""[PDF] Japan's Cybersecurity Policies"", 'snippet': ""The primary functions of the center include formulating Japan's cybersecurity poli- cies and collaborating with government ministries and agencies, acting as a ..."", 'date': None, 'last_updated': '2025-07-09', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.nisc.go.jp/eng/', 'title': 'National Cybersecurity Office | NCO - NISC', 'snippet': 'NISC plays its leading role as a focal point in coordinating intra-government collaboration and promoting partnerships between industry, academia, and public ...', 'date': '2025-08-26', 'last_updated': '2025-09-15', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://iclg.com/practice-areas/cybersecurity-laws-and-regulations/japan', 'title': 'Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations Report 2025 Japan - ICLG.com', 'snippet': 'This chapter covers common legal cybersecurity issues in Japan including cyber crime, cybersecurity laws, preventing attacks, ...', 'date': '2024-06-11', 'last_updated': '2025-09-15', 'matched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.aikido.dev/learn/compliance/compliance-frameworks/japan-cybersecurity', 'title': 'Japan Cybersecurity Laws Explained: Basic Act & APPI - Aikido', 'snippet': 'Japan Cybersecurity Act ...

foreign_affairs,Russia,low,medium,"Based on available evidence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia is not a direct stakeholder or a principal actor in the country's cybersecurity strategy or operations. The main entities responsible for cybersecurity—including both offensive and defensive cyber operations—are the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU), and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)[1][3]. These agencies, rather than the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are identified in analyses as the key state actors directly involved in cyber operations[1][3]. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs occasionally speaks publicly about cyber issues, such as claiming to be the target of foreign cyber aggression[2], but this is primarily a diplomatic and public relations function rather than evidence of operational responsibility. There is no indication in credible open-source reporting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a direct role in policymaking, operational planning, or execution of Russia's cybersecurity activities. Russia's cybersecurity framework is shaped by national security documents and coordinated among its intelligence and security services, not its diplomatic arm[1][3].","Is the department/ministry of foreign_affairs in Russia a direct stakeholder (i.e., responsible for or involved in) the country's cybersecurity?","[{'url': 'https://jsis.washington.edu/news/cybersecurity-profile-2025-russia/', 'title': 'Cybersecurity Profile 2025: Russia - The Henry M.

foreign_affairs,Slovenia,medium,high,"The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Slovenia (MFEA) is explicitly mentioned as a coordinated stakeholder involved in national cybersecurity efforts, working alongside entities like SI-CERT, the Ministry of Defence, Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency (SOVA), and Police[2]. Slovenia’s national cybersecurity strategy and structure include strengthening systemic regulation of cybersecurity assurance systems that incorporate the diplomatic and consular network, which falls under the purview of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs[1][3]. Moreover, Slovenia participates in international cybersecurity cooperation frameworks, to which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is relevant due to its diplomatic role[6]. However, direct operational responsibility for cybersecurity seems assigned primarily to entities like SI-CERT, Ministry of Defence, SOVA, and police with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs contributing to coordination, international collaboration, and diplomatic integration rather than being the primary operational actor[1][2].

However, the direct operational and policy responsibilities are assigned mainly to other bodies, such as the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection, the Security Service, the Ministry of Defense, and the Cabinet of Ministers[1][2][4].

While the prime responsibility for national cybersecurity rests with agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and specialized cyber commands, the Department of State plays a significant role in cyber diplomacy, international cybersecurity policy coordination, and threat intelligence sharing, making it a direct stakeholder in the country's cybersecurity ecosystem, particularly in the international and diplomatic arena. Hence, its involvement is not at the highest operational level but it is substantive and critical for cross-border cyber issues and diplomatic strategy related to cybersecurity[4][2][3].
