However, energy ministries globally manage critical infrastructure elements where cybersecurity is increasingly essential due to the integration of digital and operational technologies, as seen in the renewable energy sector's cybersecurity challenges and protective measures[3][4]. While Afghanistan's Ministry of Mines and Petroleum explicitly employs cybersecurity specialists to manage and secure digital infrastructures, indicating a direct cybersecurity responsibility in the natural resources sector[2], no explicit data is found for the Ministry of Energy in Afghanistan. Given that critical infrastructure ministries (like energy) generally hold at least a medium level of relevance to national cybersecurity due to their infrastructure role and digital integration, it is reasonable to assess a medium level of involvement unless specific Afghan governmental documents indicate otherwise. This assessment carries medium confidence due to limited direct information about Afghanistan's Ministry of Energy's cybersecurity role in publicly accessible sources."

Although energy is a critical infrastructure sector often linked to cybersecurity concerns, the available sources do not indicate that this Ministry has direct responsibility or a leading role in national cybersecurity policy, operations, or defense measures. Instead, its mission focuses on energy policy, regulation, investment promotion, and infrastructure development without explicit mention of cybersecurity functions or mandates[1][2][3][4]. Cybersecurity in Albania is generally overseen by designated cybersecurity agencies or authorities outside of the energy ministry domain, which aligns with typical government structures where cybersecurity is managed centrally or by specialized bodies. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy in Albania can be considered to have low direct cybersecurity stakeholder relevance, with medium confidence due to limited explicit sources on the Ministry's cybersecurity role."

    ✓ Matched",medium,medium,"The Ministry of Energy in Algeria manages critical national infrastructure including the energy sector, which is considered part of critical infrastructure requiring cybersecurity protections. However, according to available sources, the direct responsibility and coordination of Algeria's cybersecurity efforts tend to be under entities such as the Ministry of Post, Telecommunications, Technology, and Digitalization, the Ministry of National Defense (through bodies like CNSSI and ASSI), the national Computer Emergency Response Team (DZ-CERT), and legal frameworks enforced by specialized agencies. The Ministry of Energy is indirectly involved as a stakeholder due to security needs of energy infrastructure but is not identified as a leading or primary cybersecurity authority or regulator. This assessment is based on the absence of explicit citation of the Ministry of Energy as a direct cybersecurity stakeholder in Algeria in the surveyed literature, contrasted with numerous mentions of other ministries and agencies. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy has a medium-level relevance as a stakeholder given its role in critical infrastructure protection, yet lower confidence due to limited explicit references to its direct cybersecurity mandate[1][3][4][2]."

    ✓ Matched",none,medium,"There is no evidence in recent public documentation that Andorra’s Ministry or Department of Energy is a direct stakeholder, meaning it is currently responsible for or involved in the country’s national cybersecurity functions, particularly those concerning critical infrastructure. The search results highlight Andorra’s growing cybersecurity ecosystem, including the establishment of the Andorran National Cybersecurity Agency (ANC AD) and a national CSIRT to oversee and coordinate cybersecurity efforts[2]. These agencies appear to be the central authorities for national cybersecurity policy and response, rather than the energy ministry. There is also no indication in the available reports that the energy sector—or its regulatory bodies—have adopted specific cybersecurity regulations or responsibilities similar to those in other European countries, such as North Macedonia, where energy regulatory authorities are explicitly being given cybersecurity competences[1]. Andorra’s focus on cybersecurity is described more broadly, targeting economic sectors and society in general rather than singling out the energy department as a key actor[2][3]. Given the lack of direct information linking Andorra’s energy ministry to national or sectoral cybersecurity responsibilities, the most reasonable assessment is that its involvement, if any, is minimal or indirect."

Angola is developing a national cybersecurity strategy, including a National Cybersecurity Agency designed to coordinate cybersecurity initiatives across the country and act as the primary authority for monitoring and responding to threats[1]. However, for critical infrastructure sectors such as energy, research suggests that specialized sectoral Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) may be established to address cyber threats specific to that sector[4]. This implies that the energy sector would be responsible for its own cybersecurity measures in coordination with national guidelines, but would not play a direct role in national cybersecurity policy-making or oversight. There is no evidence in the available sources that the energy ministry has a direct, high-level role in Angola's overarching cybersecurity governance or policymaking. Current cybersecurity initiatives are led by entities such as the Ministry of Telecommunications, Information Technologies, and Social Communication, which are spearheading legislative efforts and public consultations on cybersecurity[3]. In summary, the Ministry of Energy’s involvement is likely focused on sectoral protection and incident response within the energy sector, rather than direct responsibility for or involvement in national cybersecurity governance."

The Cybersecurity Department within MIBUETU actively collaborates with regional partners to organize cybersecurity exercises, aiming to enhance cyber readiness within critical infrastructure sectors, which include energy and utilities[2]. This department led a recent regional cybersecurity tabletop exercise, indicating hands-on involvement in building incident response capacity among government agencies, including those in the energy sector[2]. However, primary cybersecurity policy and strategy are generally led by a central, cross-government cybersecurity authority (e.g., a national CSIRT or equivalent), for which mandatory incident reporting by critical infrastructure operators (including energy) is required[5]. While energy sector organizations are stakeholders within critical infrastructure, the ministry itself is a participant in broader national cybersecurity efforts rather than the primary authority, suggesting a moderate level of direct involvement[2][5]."

It oversees agencies such as the Azerbaijan Energy Regulatory Agency and the Azerbaijan Renewable Energy Agency, both involved in regulating energy production and supply[2][3]. While the Ministry's primary duties focus on energy production, regulation, and infrastructure, there is no explicit indication that it is directly responsible for national cybersecurity. However, given its critical role in energy infrastructure—which is a common target of cybersecurity measures—and its control over the energy regulatory apparatus, it likely has a medium involvement in cybersecurity matters concerning the protection and regulation of energy systems. This assessment is made with medium confidence due to the lack of explicit references to direct cybersecurity responsibilities in available official descriptions and regulations[1][2][3][4]."

The Bahamas’ National Cybersecurity Strategy and related workshops highlight collaboration between government agencies, critical infrastructure providers, and specialized cyber entities such as CIRT-BS, but do not explicitly list the Ministry of Energy as a direct cybersecurity stakeholder[1].

Key cybersecurity responsibilities are centralized largely under specialized government entities such as the Bangladesh e-Government Computer Incident Response Team (BGD e-GOV CIRT), the Bangladesh Computer Council, and the newly established bodies under the Cyber Security Act 2023, including the National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) and the National Cyber Security Council (NCSC)[1][2]. These organizations coordinate cybersecurity efforts across government sectors, critical information infrastructure, and national digital assets but the Ministry of Energy itself is not explicitly named as a direct actor. However, because the energy sector is typically classified as critical infrastructure, and critical information infrastructure protection is a focus of national cybersecurity strategy, the Ministry of Energy likely represents a sectoral stakeholder in terms of protecting its infrastructure against cyber threats and working with national cybersecurity bodies[1][3]. This implies an involvement at a medium relevance level due to sectoral interest and indirect role in cybersecurity resilience, rather than high-level governance or operational control of cybersecurity. The confidence is medium because this assessment is based on the absence of explicit mention of the Ministry of Energy as a direct cybersecurity stakeholder in available government and policy documents, yet logical inference from the critical infrastructure status of energy systems."

The main government body responsible for cybersecurity is the Information Systems and Digital Agency (Agence des Systèmes d'Information et du Numérique)[3], and national cybersecurity policies generally apply broadly to public sector organizations, including those managing critical infrastructure like energy[3]. While there is a strong emphasis on protecting critical infrastructure—which includes power grids—from cyberattacks under the national cybersecurity strategy[2][5], the specific involvement of the energy ministry is not detailed. The National Cybersecurity Strategy focuses on sectors such as banking, telecommunications, and public administration, but does not explicitly single out energy authorities as direct implementers or policy-makers[2][5]. The existence of mandatory cybersecurity measures for public sector organizations may include entities responsible for energy, given their role as critical infrastructure operators, but there is no direct evidence of a formal, proactive engagement or unique responsibilities assigned specifically to the energy ministry beyond general compliance[3]. Therefore, while the energy sector is likely covered by broader cybersecurity requirements as a critical infrastructure operator, the ministry’s direct role in cybersecurity is inferred rather than confirmed by available documentation."

Furthermore, Bolivia is subject to regional cybersecurity standards affecting energy data protection, but direct cybersecurity stakeholder responsibility is not specifically assigned to the Ministry of Energy. This assessment is based on general sectoral roles and the observed absence of specific references to cybersecurity responsibilities of Bolivia's energy ministry in official or regional documentation[2][5]."

There is no specific evidence that Burundi’s Ministry of Energy directly manages or is responsible for cybersecurity functions or incident response related to the energy sector. By contrast, in some other countries, Ministries of Energy have established dedicated cybersecurity departments or CSIRT teams for the energy sector, but no such information exists for Burundi[1]. Given the energy sector's increasing digitalization worldwide, it may become relevant in future.

However, there is no direct evidence that the Ministry of Energy itself holds primary responsibility or a formal role as a key cybersecurity stakeholder in Cabo Verde's national cybersecurity governance or incident response frameworks. Instead, cybersecurity appears to be coordinated at national levels involving entities such as the National Cybersecurity Council, CSIRT, and other stakeholders as described in the 2019 Cybersecurity Capacity Review for Cape Verde[1]. The country's cybersecurity efforts also include legal frameworks, awareness, and institutional coordination focused broadly rather than being specifically led by the Ministry of Energy[3][5]. Therefore, while the Ministry of Energy is indirectly relevant due to its stewardship over critical energy infrastructure that requires cybersecurity measures, its direct involvement in the country's cybersecurity governance and stakeholder framework is limited or indirect, leading to a low relevance classification with medium confidence due to absence of explicit direct stakeholder designation in available documentation."

This law imposes cybersecurity obligations on providers of essential services, including electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, which fall under the Ministry of Energy's purview. The law requires prompt reporting of cybersecurity incidents to the National CSIRT and the Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles (SEC), aligning the ministry with cybersecurity enforcement and oversight duties. Additionally, the National Cybersecurity Agency (ANCI) coordinates cyber risk management affecting critical infrastructure sectors such as energy, further underscoring the Ministry of Energy's role as a key stakeholder in national cybersecurity. These points are supported by multiple sources outlining the law's scope and technical standards for the energy sector and establishing the ministry's operational cybersecurity responsibilities[1][2][3][4]."

The Ministry of Public Security notably holds a key role in securing Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), which includes sectors such as energy, communication, finance, transportation, and water conservancy[3][6]. While the Ministry of Energy per se is not explicitly cited as a primary cybersecurity regulator, energy infrastructure falls under CII protections, implying the energy sector's involvement in cybersecurity risk management, usually coordinated with central cybersecurity authorities[3][6]. Sectoral regulators (such as the Ministry of Energy or equivalent) assist in defining entities under CII and implementing security measures but do not lead national cybersecurity policymaking or enforcement[2][4]. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy is a relevant but indirect stakeholder with medium-level involvement due to its oversight of energy infrastructure within the CII framework, coordinating with major cybersecurity bodies rather than independently managing cybersecurity responsibilities."

However, entities under the Ministry of Energy's sector, such as Recope (the Costa Rican Petroleum Refinery), are critical infrastructure and have been victims of significant cyberattacks impacting national energy security[1][2].

Primary cybersecurity responsibility at the national level is centralized in the National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC-HR), part of the Security and Intelligence Agency (SOA), which oversees multiple sectors not covered by other specified authorities[1][4]. Specific regulatory authorities such as the Croatian National Bank, HANFA, HAKOM, and others govern designated sectors like finance, banking, communication, and public sectors, but there is no direct mention of the Ministry of Energy as a cybersecurity stakeholder or regulator[1]. However, given that energy is often considered critical infrastructure, the Ministry of Energy may have an indirect role or be an interested stakeholder in cybersecurity through related regulatory frameworks or national critical infrastructure policies, but this is not explicitly documented in the Croatian national cybersecurity framework sources reviewed[1][5]. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy's involvement in Croatian cybersecurity is assessed as medium relevance: it is related but not directly responsible or a primary stakeholder for cybersecurity governance and supervision per Croatia's current legal and institutional setup."

    ✓ Matched",high,high,"The Ministry of Energy in Czechia is a direct stakeholder in the country's cybersecurity because energy is classified as a critical infrastructure sector subject to stringent cybersecurity requirements under the new Cybersecurity Act aligned with the EU's NIS2 Directive[1][3]. The law obliges entities in the energy sector, including state organizations and private companies, to implement mandatory security measures and report cyber incidents to the Government CERT, which is coordinated by the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NUKIB)[2][5]. NUKIB, the national authority, coordinates cybersecurity efforts and issues alerts specifically addressing risks in the energy sector, confirming the Ministry of Energy’s involvement in managing and overseeing these responsibilities[4][6]. The new legislation explicitly broadens the scope of regulated entities from about 400 to thousands, including those in energy, increasing their direct accountability and making top management personally responsible for cybersecurity compliance[1][3]. This comprehensive legal and operational framework shows a high relevance level of the Ministry of Energy as a cybersecurity stakeholder in Czechia."

    ✓ Matched",low,medium,"There is no direct public evidence that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) Ministry or Department of Energy is directly responsible for or involved in the country's cybersecurity operations. Cyber operations attributed to North Korea are primarily conducted by specialized intelligence and military units such as the Reconnaissance General Bureau’s Bureau 121 and associated hacker groups like Lazarus, Kimsuky, APT37, or BeagleBoyz, which focus on espionage, sabotage, and financial gain[2][3][4]. North Korea's cyber activities serve strategic purposes including intelligence gathering and funding weapons programs, but specific governance appears centralized in defense and intelligence sectors rather than civilian ministries like energy[1][4]. Moreover, North Korea’s cyber workforce also includes overseas IT workers contributing economically, but these are not linked to the energy ministry’s mandate[5]. Given DPRK’s highly centralized and militarized control over cyber operations, the energy sector's direct cybersecurity involvement likely exists only at a low operational support level rather than as core stakeholders or operators. However, due to limited transparency on DPRK's internal ministry roles and classified nature of their cyber programs, absolute certainty is unavailable and the assessment rests on available open-source intelligence and analysis."

The Ministry regulates and mandates cybersecurity preparedness measures for energy companies, including risk and vulnerability assessments, emergency preparedness coordination, and cybersecurity awareness initiatives as stipulated by new legislation and executive orders managed by the Danish Energy Agency. Moreover, energy infrastructure is recognized in national threat assessments as facing a very high risk of cybercrime and espionage, with the Ministry responsible for implementing relevant regulations and emergency response coordination in the sector.

    ✓ Matched",medium,medium,"While there is no explicit statement that Ecuador's Ministry of Energy is directly responsible for cybersecurity nationwide, cybersecurity is a critical concern for the energy sector globally and regionally, including Ecuador. The energy sector inherently involves critical infrastructure that must be protected from cyber threats, as highlighted by regional organizations such as OLADE which emphasize cybersecurity for energy generation, transmission, and distribution systems[6]. Ecuador's national cybersecurity strategy and CSIRT efforts are led primarily by the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Society, indicating central governmental cybersecurity roles lie there[2][5]. However, given the crucial importance of protecting energy infrastructure and the need for sector-specific cybersecurity measures, it is reasonable to consider Ecuador's Ministry of Energy a stakeholder with at least a moderate level of cybersecurity involvement—specifically in protecting energy systems and critical infrastructure. This aligns with typical international practices where energy ministries coordinate with cybersecurity authorities on sector-specific protections[4][6]. Because concrete Ecuador-specific documentation directly connecting the Ministry of Energy to national cybersecurity governance is limited, the confidence level is medium."

There is also an absence of a national Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) or certification frameworks related to cybersecurity. Although globally and in general energy sectors cybersecurity involvement is growing due to critical infrastructure status and increased cyber threats, in Equatorial Guinea specifically, there is no evidence that the Ministry of Energy has a direct role or is responsible for cybersecurity matters[4].

    ✓ Matched",medium,high,"The French Ministry of Energy, as part of the critical infrastructure sector, is involved indirectly in cybersecurity governance through its role overseeing energy infrastructure operators classified as critical operators. These operators must comply with cybersecurity rules approved by government authorities, and the Ministry is responsible for sector-specific regulation and oversight of energy infrastructure security, including IT security measures to secure the energy supply. However, the direct responsibility for national cybersecurity operations and incident management resides primarily with the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) under the Prime Minister's office, as well as other central bodies like SGDSN, not the Ministry of Energy itself. The Ministry is a key stakeholder because energy is considered critical infrastructure and operators under its remit must follow cybersecurity directives issued or coordinated at the national level, but it does not appear to have the frontline role in cybersecurity incident response or enforcement. Thus, the Ministry has a medium-level involvement as a policy and oversight stakeholder, collaborating with ANSSI and the national security apparatus that centrally manages cybersecurity strategy for critical infrastructure[1][2][5]. The energy sector operators themselves must implement cybersecurity measures and liaise with agencies such as ANSSI, but direct cybersecurity operational responsibility is centralized outside the Ministry of Energy[1][2]. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy is a direct cybersecurity stakeholder through its regulatory and sectoral critical infrastructure management role, but not the primary operational cybersecurity authority."

Cybersecurity responsibilities in Gabon appear to be distributed among dedicated cybersecurity agencies and general government oversight bodies rather than sectoral ministries like energy.

The primary national cybersecurity authorities include the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy (MOCDE), the Gambia ICT Agency (GICTA), the National Cybersecurity Coordination Directorate (NCCD), the National Cybersecurity Commission/Committee (NCSC), and the Gambia Computer Security and Incident Response Team (GM-CSIRT)[1][2]. Public and private sector ICT units are mentioned as supports, but there is no direct mention of energy sector institutions in the governance or implementation framework sections of these official documents[2]. Responsibility for cyber protection is framed in terms of collaboration with “all relevant stakeholders—public and private institutions that own or operate the information infrastructure,” but the energy sector is not specified among these[3]. The focus is instead on ministries and agencies directly involved in ICT, communications, and digital infrastructure. Energy sector involvement in national cybersecurity would thus be indirect—only in the sense that any critical infrastructure operator has general obligations under national policy—rather than direct or leadership responsibilities."

The central cybersecurity authority is the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), which oversees compliance, incident response, and enforcement for critical infrastructure sectors, including energy[2][5]. The BSI operates under the Federal Ministry of the Interior and for Community (BMI), which is the lead ministry for national cybersecurity policy and coordination[4][6]. The energy ministry’s role is primarily to transpose EU and national cybersecurity directives (such as NIS2) into sector-specific regulations, notably through amendments to the Energy Industry Act (EnWG) and collaboration with the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) on the IT Security Catalog for the energy sector[1]. While the energy ministry influences sectoral cybersecurity standards via legislation and subordinate regulations, it does not have direct operational or enforcement responsibilities. Its involvement is thus significant for sector-specific policy and regulatory framework adaptation, but it is not at the frontline of cyber incident management or enforcement, which rests with the BSI and BMI[1][4][6]."

    ✓ Matched",medium,high,"The department/ministry of energy in Greece is an indirect stakeholder in the country's cybersecurity, with operational rather than regulatory or oversight responsibility. Under the new NIS2 Directive, which Greece has transposed into national law (Law 5160/2024), energy sector entities—including those under the ministry of energy—are designated as 'essential entities' and thus directly subject to strict cybersecurity requirements, supervision, and potential penalties[1][3]. However, regulatory oversight and enforcement of these requirements are centralized under the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCSA), not the ministry of energy itself[2][3][5]. The NCSA, operating under the Ministry of Digital Governance, is responsible for issuing mandatory cybersecurity requirements, monitoring compliance, and coordinating cross-sector responses[5]. Sector-specific regulators (like the Regulatory Authority for Energy) may have a role in supervision and enforcement within their domains, but the primary authority and point of contact for cybersecurity at the national level is the NCSA[3]. The ministry of energy, while responsible for the operational cyber resilience of its critical infrastructure (e.g., the power grid), is not the lead regulatory or policy-making body for national cybersecurity—this role is fulfilled by the NCSA and the Ministry of Digital Governance[3][5]. The ministry's involvement is therefore substantial in terms of implementation within the energy sector, but it is not the entity directly responsible for the overarching national cybersecurity framework or enforcement[3][5]."

While energy infrastructure is critical for national security and digital operations, direct involvement in cybersecurity governance and incident response falls under broader public sector initiatives, such as those led by the Statistics and Information Technology Institute (IHSI) and other digital government agencies[1]. Current projects to improve government digital transformation and cybersecurity capacity do not specifically indicate the Ministry of Energy as a direct stakeholder in cybersecurity matters; instead, these cybersecurity efforts are coordinated at the level of digital governance bodies and ministries directly responsible for information technology and public sector digital security[1].

Cybersecurity oversight in Honduras is primarily led by the Ministry of Security, the Honduran Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (CONATEL), and the National Cybersecurity Center, which formulate, implement, and enforce broader national cybersecurity policies and regulations[1]. The ministry/agency responsible for energy is not listed among the key government entities shaping Honduras' cybersecurity landscape[1]. While global best practices often involve energy ministries in critical infrastructure protection, Honduran documents do not specify such a role in the energy sector. The National Cyber Security Index for Honduras confirms that there is no public record of a legal act identifying operators of essential services (which typically includes energy), nor does it indicate cyber requirements specific to these sectors[4]. However, the general legal and regulatory framework may indirectly apply to energy providers as digital service operators, but direct involvement or responsibility of the energy ministry in cybersecurity remains undocumented."

The main supervisory authority for most sectors—including energy, unless noted otherwise—is the Supervisory Authority for Regulated Activities (SZTFH), which oversees private sector essential and important entities (e.g., energy companies), sets compliance requirements, conducts inspections, and enforces cybersecurity rules[1]. The new regulatory framework clearly differentiates between essential and important entities, and energy sector operators in high-risk or risky categories are likely classified as essential, subjecting them to stricter cybersecurity obligations[5]. The Ministry of Defence has competence over the defence sector, and the National Security Authority (NBH) handles public administration, but there is no explicit mention of the Ministry of Energy as a direct regulatory or supervisory body for cybersecurity[1]. The ministry’s involvement is thus mainly sectoral—indirectly, through regulatory oversight of energy operators as critical infrastructure, but not as a cybersecurity authority in its own right[5]. No direct evidence was found that the Ministry of Energy itself conducts inspections, audits, or enforces cybersecurity rules; these functions are centralized with SZTFH for most sectors[1]."

Specialized cyber units such as APT33 and APT34 conduct cyber attacks against critical sectors including the energy sector, indicating that cybersecurity efforts actively target energy infrastructure but do not suggest that the Ministry of Energy itself is a primary cybersecurity actor[1]. The ministry's organizational role is not described as directly managing cybersecurity activities; instead, cyber operations are executed by IRGC, MOIS, and affiliated contractors including private firms and academic institutions under political leadership[2][5]. Furthermore, Iran’s Communications and Information Technology Ministry is explicitly identified as a strategic cyber stakeholder focusing on national cybersecurity priorities and digital infrastructure protection and promotion[4]. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy in Iran is likely a medium-level stakeholder, probably responsible for cooperating on cybersecurity matters related to its sector but not serving as a central or direct cybersecurity operational authority. This assessment has high confidence given multiple authoritative sources outlining Iran's cyber organizational structure and stakeholders without naming the Ministry of Energy as a core direct cyber operator or policymaker."

The Ministry’s remit explicitly includes energy alongside science and technology, indicating an institutional integration of cybersecurity related to these sectors[3][4]. The Ministry publicly emphasizes enhancing cybersecurity infrastructure and legislative frameworks to protect digital systems nationally, which includes digital infrastructure relevant to energy systems[3][4]. However, information does not suggest the Ministry of Energy alone (if considered distinct from the combined ministry) functions as a primary or sole cybersecurity stakeholder; rather, cybersecurity efforts are under the broader combined Ministry of Science, Energy, Technology and Mining. Therefore, its involvement is significant but typically part of a broader portfolio, putting its cybersecurity stakeholder role at a medium level rather than high. This conclusion is supported by government statements and strategy documents focusing on ICT and national cybersecurity initiatives under this combined ministry’s leadership rather than a standalone Ministry of Energy focus[1][3][5]."

However, the national-level cybersecurity strategy and coordination are primarily led by other bodies such as the Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters headed by the Chief Cabinet Secretary and the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC)[1][5].

However, the ministry has an indirect role because energy infrastructure is considered Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) whose protection is mandated under Kenya’s cybersecurity strategy[2][6]. The National Cybersecurity Strategy and the Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act emphasize protecting critical information infrastructures vital to the nation’s security and economy, including energy systems, thus involving the sector in cybersecurity indirectly through critical infrastructure protection mandates[2][3][6]. Kenya’s cybersecurity efforts are coordinated mainly by multi-agency entities led by the Communications Authority and security agencies, not the Ministry of Energy itself[1][6].

However, the energy sector is recognized as one of the critical infrastructures to be protected under the national cybersecurity strategy, indicating that the Ministry of Energy has sector-specific responsibilities for cybersecurity within its domain[3]. The Cybersecurity Strategy explicitly includes the energy industry among ten priority sectors requiring protection but does not assign direct cybersecurity policy leadership to the Ministry of Energy itself[3]. Instead, coordination and regulation are managed centrally, with sector ministries expected to maintain cybersecurity within their areas in alignment with national policies[2]. Given this division of responsibilities, the Ministry of Energy is a direct stakeholder at least at a medium level due to its involvement in securing energy infrastructure, but not a primary decision-maker or lead authority on cybersecurity overall."

However, energy providers are explicitly categorized as providers of essential services subject to cybersecurity regulations under Latvia's National Cyber Security Law and the NIS2 Directive implementation, implying their involvement in cybersecurity compliance requirements and interactions with the National Cyber Security Centre[1][2][3]. Thus, while the Ministry of Energy itself is not directly responsible for cybersecurity at the national policy or coordination level, it is a stakeholder insofar as the energy sector must comply with cybersecurity mandates and coordinate cybersecurity efforts for critical infrastructure. This situates the Ministry of Energy as a medium-relevance stakeholder connected to cybersecurity primarily through sectoral compliance and operational security within its domain rather than overarching policy or incident response leadership."

    ✓ Matched",medium,medium,"The Ministry of Energy and Water (MOEW) in Lebanon is mentioned among the various ministries whose websites and applications are hosted by OMSAR, which develops national cybersecurity policy guidelines for all public agencies[1][2]. This implies the MOEW has some involvement in implementing cybersecurity policies relevant to its IT infrastructure. However, in the establishment and leadership of national cybersecurity strategy, the primary stakeholders are entities such as the Presidency of the Council of Ministers (PCM), the Office of the Minister of State for Administrative Reform (OMSAR), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MOIM), the Ministry of Defense (MOD), and others focused on security and defense[1][3][4]. The National Cybersecurity Committee, chaired by the secretary-general of the Higher Defense Council, is the main body overseeing strategy development and implementation[3][5]. There is no explicit indication that the Ministry of Energy acts as a lead or primary cybersecurity stakeholder at a national policy or strategic level. Given the energy sector's critical infrastructure role generally warrants cybersecurity attention, the MOEW likely has operational cybersecurity responsibilities, but it is not identified as a direct national cybersecurity policymaker or coordinator in Lebanon. Hence, the MOEW's role is assessed as medium relevance with medium confidence due to indirect but present involvement in cybersecurity implementations at the ministry level rather than at the national strategic leadership level."

While Libya's energy sector—a critical infrastructure—has been a target of cyberattacks (specifically DDoS attacks against oil companies), responsibility for detecting, responding to, and coordinating cybersecurity incidents at the national level lies with the National Information Security and Safety Authority (NISSA) and Libya CERT, which are specifically designated to coordinate cybersecurity efforts nationwide[2]. These specialized agencies, not the Ministry of Energy, are recognized as the main stakeholders for national cybersecurity policy and incident response[2]. However, energy companies such as the National Oil Corporation (NOC) must have internal security measures to protect their own infrastructure given their strategic importance, but this is distinct from having a formal, national cybersecurity policy or enforcement role.

The CSG applies broadly to essential and important entities across sectors.

The cybersecurity framework involves cross-sector cooperation and regulatory oversight but centralizes direct authority in the National Cyber Security Unit and related bodies, not the energy ministry itself[2][4].

The Critical Infrastructures Act sets out security obligations for both energy and transport sectors, which implies some level of involvement indirectly through the broader national cybersecurity framework[1]. Additionally, the National Cybersecurity Strategy and the Interministerial Coordination Committee for Cyber Prevention and Cybersecurity play significant roles in coordinating cybersecurity efforts across various sectors, including critical infrastructures[3][5]. Therefore, while the Department of Energy might not be a direct stakeholder, it is indirectly involved through regulatory compliance and sectoral cybersecurity initiatives."

This implies responsibility for safeguarding critical energy infrastructure against cyber threats. The Act establishes sector leads for NCII sectors who regulate entities within their sectors, indicating that the Ministry of Energy likely has a coordinating role as a sector lead for energy-related infrastructure cybersecurity[1][2]. However, the primary national cybersecurity agency, the National Cyber Security Agency (NACSA), operates under the Ministry of Communications and Digital, not the Ministry of Energy[6].

This assessment is based on the legislative and organizational roles outlined in recent 2024 cybersecurity laws and government agency structures."

There is limited evidence linking the Ministry or Department of Energy directly to cybersecurity responsibilities. Most cybersecurity efforts appear to be national and general in scope rather than sector-specific, especially given the absence of a national Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) and comprehensive cybercrime laws. While energy sector entities globally often have cybersecurity roles (as noted for example in the US Department of Energy's cybersecurity initiatives), no specific evidence was found that the Marshall Islands' Ministry of Energy plays a direct or significant role in cybersecurity matters in the country [2][6][7]. Thus, the Ministry of Energy in the Marshall Islands is likely not a direct cybersecurity stakeholder but may be indirectly involved if national policies evolve to include sector-specific responsibilities."

However, there is clear international cooperation focused on the cybersecurity of energy infrastructures, indicating involvement of the energy sector in cybersecurity matters[2]. Additionally, Mauritania's energy sector, including major projects related to gas and renewable energy, is considered critical infrastructure vulnerable to cyber threats, which implies a role for the Ministry of Energy in ensuring cybersecurity coordination or considerations for these infrastructures[4][5]. Given that energy infrastructure cybersecurity is a strategic focus in collaborations and that the Ministry of Energy is a key player in energy development and infrastructure, it can be inferred that the Ministry is a medium-level stakeholder in cybersecurity, involved indirectly through protecting critical energy assets and in coordination with broader national cybersecurity efforts, but not the primary entity responsible for cybersecurity governance per se."

Cybersecurity responsibilities in Mexico are fragmented among various agencies, including the National Response Centre for Cyber Incidents (CERT-MX) and sector-specific regulators, but there is no direct evidence that the Ministry of Energy itself holds primary or formal responsibility for national cybersecurity governance or incident response[3][4]. The energy sector faces significant cybersecurity risks and challenges partly because of the absence of unified legislation or specific regulatory authority addressing energy cybersecurity[5]. Recent legislative efforts propose creating a centralized National Cybersecurity Agency and legal frameworks that would likely affect all sectors; however, as of mid-2025, no clear assignment of direct cybersecurity responsibility to the Ministry of Energy exists[6]. Therefore, while the Ministry of Energy is a stakeholder by virtue of overseeing critical infrastructure with cybersecurity risks, its role in direct cybersecurity responsibility is currently limited or medium rather than high."

However, explicit direct responsibility or operational roles in national cybersecurity strategy or cyber defense for energy infrastructure are not detailed in available sources, indicating involvement but not primary or high-level responsibility for cybersecurity matters itself. Cybersecurity in Montenegro is generally managed by specialized agencies and regulatory bodies, with the Energy Regulatory Agency being independent for sector regulation but not explicitly described as a cybersecurity entity[1].

Moreover, securing energy systems, including renewable energy infrastructure, involves implementing cybersecurity controls and protocols such as access control and anomaly detection—activities that the Ministry of Energy would oversee or coordinate[5]. While the national cybersecurity authority (DGSSI) is responsible for the overall state cybersecurity strategy and supervision, the Ministry of Energy must engage in cybersecurity governance to protect energy assets from cyber threats[4].

The Cybersecurity Central Committee (CCC) assigns tasks and responsibilities to ministries relevant to cybersecurity; thus, the Ministry of Energy is likely involved in developing cybersecurity plans and incident response pertaining to the energy sector’s critical infrastructure[1]. However, the primary focal ministry and department for cybersecurity implementation are the Ministry of Transport and Communications and its Department of Information Technology and Cyber Security, which centrally manage national cybersecurity policies and licensing[4][5]. While the Ministry of Energy is a stakeholder due to the critical infrastructure under its remit, it is not the key executive body for national cybersecurity policy or enforcement.

The Ministry is not the primary actor for cybersecurity, but it plays a role in shaping policy, especially through its involvement in transposing EU directives such as the Network and Information Security Directive 2 (NIS2) into national law and supporting sector-specific cybersecurity initiatives[1]. The National Digital Infrastructure Inspectorate (RDI) is the designated supervisory authority for cybersecurity compliance in the energy sector, not the Ministry itself[1]. Therefore, the Ministry is an important but indirect stakeholder, setting policy direction rather than directly enforcing or operating cyber defenses[1]. The Dutch government's general cybersecurity strategy similarly emphasizes that responsibility is distributed across government, sectors, and specialized agencies, with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and RDI handling most direct cybersecurity functions[2][3]."

These cyber security standards aim to protect industrial control systems essential to power infrastructure, an area closely linked to the energy sector. However, the primary government cybersecurity responsibilities lie within the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) under the GCSB, and cyber policy oversight is allocated to the Minister for Communications, Broadcasting and Digital Media, with the Minister of National Security and Intelligence also playing a key role[2][3][5]. There is no explicit designation of the Ministry of Energy as a lead or direct stakeholder in national cybersecurity policy or operational agencies. Instead, the Ministry of Energy's role on cybersecurity is more about ensuring resilience and compliance within the critical energy infrastructure it oversees, aligning with broader government cybersecurity strategies and standards[1][4].

There is no specific mention of Nicaragua’s energy ministry collaborating with cybersecurity agencies or being tasked with cyber defense or policy responsibilities. Available cybersecurity references for Nicaragua focus primarily on the existence of a legal framework for cybercrime (such as Special Cybercrime Law N°. 1042) and on a national entity with awareness-raising responsibilities, without specifying sectoral ministries as key stakeholders[2]. Much of the literature on cybersecurity in energy sectors describes general requirements for nations and companies—such as implementing robust security strategies, collaborating with government, and protecting critical infrastructure—but does not reference Nicaragua’s energy ministry or provide case-specific evidence of its direct cyber role[1][3]. Given the lack of direct evidence, the assessment is that the ministry's involvement in national cybersecurity is likely minimal, but this must be interpreted cautiously due to limited country-specific data."

    ✓ Matched",medium,high,"The Nigerian Ministry/Department of Energy is a medium-level direct stakeholder in the country's cybersecurity landscape, primarily because the energy sector is considered critical infrastructure that is increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks as it adopts more digital technologies[1]. Nigerian legislation such as the Cybercrimes Act, 2015, aims to protect vital national information infrastructure, which includes the energy sector[1]. While the national cybersecurity policy assigns central coordination to bodies like the National Cyber Crime Commission (NCCC) and the Nigeria Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT), sector-specific entities, including those in energy, must implement cybersecurity measures and coordinate with these federal agencies[2]. This implicates the Ministry of Energy as responsible for developing, enforcing, or at least collaborating on cybersecurity policies and practices that protect the energy infrastructure. International analogues, such as the U.S. Department of Energy's role as Energy Sector-Specific Agency coordinating cybersecurity incident response and preparedness, also suggest that energy ministries typically hold significant cybersecurity responsibilities in their jurisdictions[4]. However, the primary cybersecurity mandate and enforcement rest with specialized cybersecurity agencies, while the Ministry of Energy manages domain-specific cybersecurity concerns, operational continuity, risk assessments, and compliance guidance in the energy sector[1][2]. Therefore, while the Ministry of Energy is not the lead national cybersecurity authority, it is a key sectoral stakeholder and responsible entity within Nigeria's overall cybersecurity framework."

Though direct responsibility for cybersecurity is assigned to MTCIT and its initiatives such as OCERT, which serves as the national Computer Emergency Readiness Team supporting both governmental and private sectors including critical national infrastructure[1][2], specific references to the Ministry of Energy having a direct cybersecurity mandate or role are absent from the search results. The focus of cybersecurity governance, incident management, and regulations is centered on MTCIT and related agencies, with no explicit mention of the Energy Ministry's involvement. Given that energy sectors are often part of critical national infrastructure protected under OCERT's scope, the Ministry of Energy likely has an indirect cybersecurity stakeholder role through operational engagement and compliance requirements, but it is not identified as a primary or direct cybersecurity governance stakeholder in Oman by these sources."

Specifically, the Ministry participates in National CERT's 'CyberSecureGov' initiative focused on cybersecurity strategies and frameworks for safeguarding government digital assets, indicating direct involvement in cybersecurity matters at least at a strategic and policy level[1]. Moreover, the energy sector's IT/OT cybersecurity is emphasized by regulatory bodies like NEPRA through programs like 'Power with Security,' highlighting the sector's role in the cybersecurity landscape[3]. While the Ministry is not solely responsible for national cybersecurity, it is a key stakeholder due to the criticality of energy infrastructure in national cyber defense and resilience. This involvement is consistent with national cybersecurity governance frameworks that include multiple ministries responsible for critical infrastructure protection, though operational cybersecurity leadership is generally led by entities like the National CERT and Ministry of IT & Telecom[1][3][5]. Thus, the Ministry of Energy's cybersecurity role is primarily as a stakeholder responsible for managing cybersecurity risks relevant to the energy sector's critical systems and infrastructure."

The national security strategy emphasizes protection of critical infrastructure including the power grid, highlighting the importance of cybersecurity in energy infrastructure[2]. However, there is no direct indication that the Department or Ministry of Energy in Palau is explicitly responsible for or directly involved in managing or handling the country's cybersecurity. Most references underline a centralized approach by government IT offices and sector-specific cybersecurity roles rather than the energy ministry being a primary stakeholder. The general role of governments worldwide includes developing cyber policies for energy sectors[5], but no specific evidence links Palau's energy ministry as a direct cybersecurity stakeholder. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy in Palau likely has low direct involvement in cybersecurity, with cybersecurity responsibilities centralized elsewhere within government administration."

Given the globally recognized importance of cybersecurity in protecting energy sector operations and critical infrastructure, cybersecurity has increasingly become a strategic concern in such ministries to ensure resilience and continuity against cyber-attacks[1]. While there is no direct explicit statement that the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines operates its own cybersecurity authority or directly manages national cyber defense, the ministry is a natural stakeholder due to its governance over energy policy and critical infrastructure which is vulnerable to cyber threats. Analogous U.S. contexts show that energy departments typically have dedicated cybersecurity offices or responsibilities for protecting energy security and infrastructure cyber risks[5][8]. However, no concrete evidence was found indicating that MEM in Peru currently leads or is formally responsible for the country's broader national cybersecurity initiatives outside the energy sector. Thus, MEM’s involvement can be assessed as having medium relevance as a cybersecurity stakeholder in its sector, with medium confidence due to limited direct confirmation from available sources."

    ✓ Matched",medium,high,"The Ministry of Energy in the Republic of Korea is not explicitly identified as a leading authority or primary stakeholder directly responsible for national cybersecurity. South Korea's cybersecurity governance is described as fragmented among several key ministries, including the Ministry of Science and ICT (which is actively involved in cybersecurity policy and operations), the Ministry of Interior and Safety, the Ministry of National Defense, and intelligence agencies like the National Intelligence Service[1][2][3]. The energy sector is recognized as part of critical infrastructure vulnerable to cyber threats, and thus the Ministry of Energy would have a role in cybersecurity related to its sector; however, overarching cybersecurity responsibilities are distributed among other ministries and agencies. The energy ministry would plausibly be involved in protecting the cybersecurity of energy infrastructure but is not cited as a central or direct national cybersecurity stakeholder in governance or policy frameworks. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy holds a medium relevance level as a cybersecurity stakeholder due to its sectoral responsibility within the critical infrastructure framework but does not serve as a direct or primary national cybersecurity authority. The confidence in this assessment is high based on multiple authoritative analyses of South Korea's cybersecurity structure emphasizing the dominance of other ministries and intelligence services in national cybersecurity leadership[1][2][3]."

It has established the Cybersecurity Incident Response Center in Energy (CRISCE), which operates under its direct subordination. This center is dedicated to monitoring, preventing, and responding to cyber incidents targeting critical energy infrastructure, including protection against ransomware and attacks on SCADA systems. The Ministry of Energy not only oversees this center but also engages in coordinating national and international efforts to safeguard the energy sector from cyber threats. The creation and staffing of CRISCE, with highly qualified cybersecurity specialists remunerated competitively, further demonstrate the Ministry's active role in cybersecurity.

Given the energy sector's critical role and exposure to cyber threats, the Ministry of Energy holds responsibility for protecting this infrastructure from digital threats.

Although the energy sector globally is recognized as part of critical infrastructure requiring cybersecurity measures, specific evidence about San Marino’s energy ministry involvement in cybersecurity is lacking in governmental and international reports, including San Marino's 2030 Agenda implementation documents where IT and Technology Offices are noted for data and technology roles but without explicit linkage to the energy sector or ministry cybersecurity functions[8]. Therefore, the energy ministry in San Marino is likely only indirectly related or involved in cybersecurity matters, with actual cybersecurity governance probably managed by other entities or cross-sectoral bodies."

Government consultations for establishing cybersecurity response teams (CSIRT) focus on technical agencies and relevant ministries, with no specific mention of the energy sector as a direct cybersecurity stakeholder[2].

Cybersecurity in energy is deemed a vital part of protecting critical infrastructure, especially considering the past cyberattacks like the Shamoon attack on Saudi Aramco, a major entity under the Ministry of Energy, which highlighted the need for robust cybersecurity protocols in energy[5]. Moreover, Saudi Arabia's national cybersecurity frameworks and laws explicitly involve governmental bodies handling critical sectors such as energy to comply with cybersecurity controls and regulations to protect national assets and promote digital resilience[2][4][6].

Amendments to national laws address cybersecurity mechanisms in the energy sector, including the identification and designation of critical energy infrastructure, which typically falls under the remit of the Ministry of Energy or related regulatory bodies. Although the primary responsibility for national information security tasks, such as approval of cryptographic products and national cybersecurity policies, lies with other ministries (e.g., the Ministry of Defense and the Agency for Electronic Communications as per Serbian Law on Information Security), the Ministry of Energy is a stakeholder in applying cybersecurity standards and cooperating in incident response within the energy sector. This indicates a medium level of involvement, as they are stakeholders in protecting critical infrastructure but not the principal authority for cybersecurity governance nationwide[1][2][3][4]."

The National Cybersecurity Strategy and Policy documents emphasize critical sectors including financial services, fisheries, tourism, ICT & broadcasting, health, government services, public utilities, transport, and logistics, but do not specifically highlight the Ministry of Energy or energy sector as a direct cybersecurity stakeholder[3][4].

    ✓ Matched",medium,high,"The Ministry of Trade and Industry in Singapore oversees the Energy Market Authority (EMA), which is responsible for ensuring a reliable and secure energy supply, including electricity and gas. While EMA performs roles critical to energy reliability and sector development, it operates primarily as an industry regulator and system operator rather than a direct cybersecurity agency. However, EMA's Power Systems Operator role involves overseeing the power grid operations and system control centers, which inherently require aspects of cybersecurity to maintain energy system stability and security. Thus, the ministry (through EMA) is indirectly involved in Singapore's cybersecurity landscape concerning energy infrastructure. There is no indication that the Ministry of Energy itself has direct responsibility for national cybersecurity policies or cyber defense outside the energy sector. Hence, its cybersecurity stakeholder relevance is assessed as medium due to its role in critical infrastructure security and energy supply reliability, but not as a primary or direct cybersecurity agency [1][6]."

However, systemic cybersecurity responsibilities, including incident coordination, setting national cybersecurity standards, and enforcing compliance, primarily reside with the National Security Authority and the National CSIRT, along with specific government CSIRT units[1][4][5]. The Ministry of Energy itself is not explicitly named as the competent authority for cybersecurity nationwide but is involved as a sectoral stakeholder given its regulatory and supervisory role in energy infrastructure. The sector's cybersecurity duties involve coordination with national cybersecurity bodies and compliance with laws focusing on critical infrastructure protection[3][5].

The National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS), developed through interministerial coordination including the Energy Agency of the Republic of Slovenia, integrates energy sector considerations in cybersecurity management[1]. Operators of critical infrastructure in the energy sector (electricity producers and distributors) are explicitly identified as important stakeholders in the national cyber security assurance system[3][5]. This implies that the Ministry of Energy has direct responsibility for or involvement in cybersecurity policies and protective measures related to energy infrastructure. Although other cybersecurity authorities exist (such as the Information Security Agency, SI-CERT, SIGOV-CERT, and Ministry of Digital Transformation), the energy ministry is a central stakeholder specifically due to its sectoral responsibility for critical energy infrastructure, where cybersecurity is a key mandate[1][3][5]. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy in Slovenia is a direct cybersecurity stakeholder with high importance and relevance in national cybersecurity governance."

Furthermore, the energy sector's digitization and the increasing cyber threats documented emphasize the Ministry's indirect but significant stake in cybersecurity to protect infrastructure integrity and national security interests[2]. However, the primary official cybersecurity governance and strategic coordination appear to be handled by other entities such as the Department of Communication and Digital Technologies, CSIR, and specific cybersecurity hubs[3].

The law mandates entities in high criticality sectors, including energy (encompassing electricity, oil, gas, hydrogen, and district heating/cooling systems), to implement cybersecurity risk management, conduct risk assessments, and report significant incidents[1][4]. Recent events such as the April 2025 blackout have heightened government scrutiny on the cybersecurity measures of energy facilities, with the Ministry of Energy actively involved in investigations and public communications about potential cyberattack risks to energy infrastructure[2]. Furthermore, the National Cybersecurity Center coordinates cybersecurity activities, including oversight of the energy sector, which is under the direct remit of the Ministry of Energy for implementation and compliance[1][3].

Suriname's energy sector discussions and conferences mention cybersecurity as one of several topics alongside digital transformation, but this does not indicate direct operational responsibility or stakeholder status for cybersecurity by the Ministry of Energy itself[2].

Additionally, sectoral cybersecurity regulatory roles often involve the Ministry of Energy, as suggested by the World Bank's Sectoral Cybersecurity Maturity Model that lists Ministries of Energy as sector supervisory authorities responsible for cybersecurity oversight in their sectors[1]. While direct evidence of the Ministry being a primary national cybersecurity stakeholder is limited, these references imply a medium relevance level: the Ministry is a cybersecurity stakeholder mainly concerning its sectoral critical infrastructure and internal IT system security. No indication was found that it leads or coordinates national-level cybersecurity strategy or policy, which would denote higher involvement.

Current cybersecurity initiatives, strategic discussions, and international cooperation efforts in Timor-Leste focus primarily on national-level institutions such as the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, National Intelligence Service, and broader governmental coordination frameworks rather than on the energy sector specifically[1]. Cybersecurity strategy development is aimed at national digital infrastructure and governance, with no direct mention of the energy ministry's role[2]. While energy infrastructure may be critical infrastructure subject to cybersecurity protection generally, there is no direct evidence that Timor-Leste’s Department of Energy is a primary stakeholder or responsible entity for cybersecurity. The focus is on whole-of-government approaches and inter-institutional coordination without specific attribution to the energy sector[1][5].

    ✓ Matched",low,high,"The National Agency for Cybersecurity (ANCy) in Togo is the designated authority responsible for cybersecurity regulation, oversight, and enforcement across essential service operators and infrastructures, including digital sectors, but it is placed under the supervision of the ministry in charge of the digital economy and security, not specifically the Ministry of Energy[1][2][3][4]. There is no evidence that the Ministry of Energy itself has direct responsibility or a significant role in national cybersecurity policies, strategy, or operational cybersecurity activities. The relevant cybersecurity functions, such as operating the National CERT and Security Operations Center, awareness-raising, and compliance audits, are centralized under ANCy and its operational arm, Cyber Defense Africa (CDA), rather than sectoral ministries including energy[1][2][4][6]. While the energy sector might be considered an essential service that benefits from cybersecurity oversight, it is not indicated to be a direct cybersecurity stakeholder or responsible for cybersecurity governance in Togo. Therefore, the Ministry/Department of Energy’s involvement in cybersecurity is low and indirect, primarily as a critical infrastructure operator rather than as a cybersecurity policymaker or operator."

    ✓ Matched",low,high,"The Ministry responsible for Energy in Tonga, as defined in the Energy Act 2021 and related documents, primarily focuses on managing, coordinating, and regulating the energy sector, including electricity, petroleum, renewable energy, and related infrastructure and policy development[1][3]. The ministry's functions emphasize energy system resilience, affordability, and sustainable energy provision, alongside regulatory and technical support roles[1][3]. There is no indication in the legislative frameworks or official policy documents that the Ministry of Energy holds direct responsibility for cybersecurity governance, oversight, or operational roles related to cyber defense or cybersecurity management within Tonga's government or critical infrastructure sectors[1][2][3][5]. Cybersecurity roles, especially those involving safeguarding information and communication technologies, typically fall under other ministries or agencies focused on communications, digital governance, or national security. The Energy Department mentioned under the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Natural Resources is involved in technical regulation of energy projects but without explicit linkage to cybersecurity functions[5]. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy in Tonga is only tangentially related to cybersecurity to the extent that energy infrastructure may require ICT protection, which is common but not a direct mandate noted in Tonga's legal or regulatory documents available. This assessment is made with high confidence due to the specificity of multiple official sources outlining the ministry's energy-focused mandate and absence of cybersecurity responsibility mention therein."

There is no evidence in the available sources that the Ministry (or Department) of Energy is directly involved in setting cybersecurity policy, coordinating cyber incident response, or leading cybersecurity awareness activities[1][2].

    ✓ Matched",medium,high,"The Ministry of Energy in Turkey is likely a direct stakeholder in the country's cybersecurity primarily because energy infrastructure is considered critical infrastructure, which is a key focus area in Turkey's cybersecurity laws. The new Cyber Security Law (Law No. 7545) and the establishment of the Cyber Security Presidency and Cybersecurity Administration emphasize protecting critical infrastructures, coordinating cyber response efforts, and developing national cybersecurity policies. While the Cybersecurity Council and Administration explicitly include ministers from Interior, Justice, Defense, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Industry and Technology ministries, the energy sector, as part of critical infrastructure, falls under the scope of cybersecurity risk identification and mitigation efforts led by these central bodies. The Ministry of Energy would thus have responsibilities related to cybersecurity measures for energy systems and infrastructure, coordinating with the Cybersecurity Directorate under the Presidency. However, the primary strategic and policy coordination on national cybersecurity is led by the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, as per prior strategic leadership mandates. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy is a medium-level stakeholder, involved due to its critical infrastructure role but not the primary lead agency on national cybersecurity policy or enforcement[1][3][4][5]."

    ✓ Matched",medium,high,"The Ministry of Energy in Uganda is likely a cybersecurity stakeholder with a medium level of involvement because the country's cybersecurity strategy and frameworks recognize the need to protect Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), which includes sectors like power and utilities typically overseen by the Ministry of Energy. Uganda's National Cybersecurity Strategy and related documents highlight government commitments to protect critical infrastructure sectors such as power, which would fall under the Ministry of Energy's purview. However, formal assignments and direct responsibilities for cybersecurity often appear centralized in entities like the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance and the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC), which handle national cybersecurity policy and incident response. IT departments within ministries, including the Ministry of Energy, are responsible for internal IT security and incident handling, indicating involvement but not necessarily leading national cybersecurity efforts. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy is a relevant stakeholder for protecting cyber aspects of energy infrastructure but with medium—not high—cybersecurity responsibility compared with primary cyber agencies[1][2][4]."

The National Cybersecurity Council, established by Presidential Decree in August 2024, explicitly includes ministries such as Defense, Science and Technology, Economy, Finance and Foreign Trade, Foreign Relations, Internal Relations, Justice and Peace, Planning, and National Commerce, but the Ministry of Energy is not mentioned as part of this council or directly responsible for cybersecurity matters[1][2]. Cybersecurity efforts have prominently involved the Ministry of Science and Technology, which proposed the formation of the National Cybersecurity Council to address cyberattacks affecting critical national infrastructure, highlighting their lead role in cybersecurity strategy and response[3][5]. While energy infrastructure (such as power grids) is a common target in cyber threats globally, the information available does not indicate that Venezuela’s Ministry of Energy holds a direct cybersecurity mandate or acts as a primary cybersecurity stakeholder. The Ministry of Energy might be indirectly impacted by cybersecurity policies and protection measures but is not documented as a direct cybersecurity stakeholder or responsible agency in the current institutional framework[1][3].

The Ministry of Energy is categorized within sectors managing critical information systems (such as energy), thus it must comply with cybersecurity regulations and implement technical security measures mandated under the Law on Cybersecurity and related decrees (e.g., Decree 53/2022) for its operational systems[3]. However, the Ministry/Department of Energy is not a direct cybersecurity stakeholder responsible for national cyber governance or enforcement roles but rather a sectoral operator required to meet cybersecurity standards imposed by regulatory bodies. Therefore, its role in cybersecurity is operational and compliance-focused (medium to low level) rather than a direct governance and policymaking stakeholder (which is led by MPS). This assessment reflects public legal documents and government organizational changes leading to consolidation of cybersecurity authority exclusively under MPS, with no indication that the Ministry of Energy holds direct responsibility for national cybersecurity policies or enforcement[2][5][6]."

The Public Telecommunications Corporation, intelligence apparatus, and government entities tied to internet infrastructure play key roles in Yemen's cybersecurity landscape, including monitoring, vulnerability management, and regulations[1][4]. There is no explicit evidence that Yemen's Ministry or Department of Energy is directly responsible for or heavily involved in national cybersecurity management or protection of cyber infrastructure. While governments generally have roles in regulating and protecting energy infrastructure cybersecurity, Yemen-specific data shows the Ministry of Energy is not identified as a direct cybersecurity stakeholder or lead agency[3][1]. The involvement of energy ministries in cybersecurity is more documented in other countries (e.g., U.S. Department of Energy), but no Yemen-specific sources confirm such a role for Yemen's Ministry of Energy[2]. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy in Yemen is likely a low-level stakeholder, if at all, in the country's cybersecurity ecosystem."

    ✓ Matched",medium,medium,"The Cyber Security Act (2025) in Zambia establishes institutional structures such as the Zambia Cyber Security Agency and Cyber Incident Response Teams tasked with developing national capacity to respond to cyber threats[1]. The law defines ""critical information"" and ""critical sectors,"" which include public sector information and ICT, potentially encompassing ministries such as the Ministry of Energy due to its role in critical infrastructure[2]. Although the Ministry of Energy is a key stakeholder in national critical infrastructure and thus indirectly involved in cybersecurity issues, there is no explicit indication that it has direct responsibility or formal role as a cybersecurity stakeholder like the Cyber Security Agency or law enforcement entities. The Agency is centrally placed under the President's Office and has broad audit and intervention powers, suggesting primary cybersecurity responsibility lies there rather than individual ministries[3]. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy in Zambia is likely a relevant stakeholder mostly as a custodian or operator of critical infrastructure dependent on cybersecurity protections, but it is not a direct cybersecurity authority. This assessment carries medium confidence due to the lack of specific references directly assigning cybersecurity responsibility to the Ministry of Energy in the cited official legislation and analyses."
