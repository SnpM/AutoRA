Slovenia\u2019s national cybersecurity strategy and structure include strengthening systemic regulation of cybersecurity assurance systems that incorporate the diplomatic and consular network, which falls under the purview of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs[1][3]. Moreover, Slovenia participates in international cybersecurity cooperation frameworks, to which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is relevant due to its diplomatic role[6]. However, direct operational responsibility for cybersecurity seems assigned primarily to entities like SI-CERT, Ministry of Defence, SOVA, and police with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs contributing to coordination, international collaboration, and diplomatic integration rather than being the primary operational actor[1][2]. This justifies a medium relevance level with high confidence based on the official sources available."},"parsing_success":true,"parsing_error":null,"retries_used":0}
