There is also no indication in the available reports that the energy sector\u2014or its regulatory bodies\u2014have adopted specific cybersecurity regulations or responsibilities similar to those in other European countries, such as North Macedonia, where energy regulatory authorities are explicitly being given cybersecurity competences[1].

Angola is developing a national cybersecurity strategy, including a National Cybersecurity Agency designed to coordinate cybersecurity initiatives across the country and act as the primary authority for monitoring and responding to threats[1]. However, for critical infrastructure sectors such as energy, research suggests that specialized sectoral Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) may be established to address cyber threats specific to that sector[4]. This implies that the energy sector would be responsible for its own cybersecurity measures in coordination with national guidelines, but would not play a direct role in national cybersecurity policy-making or oversight. There is no evidence in the available sources that the energy ministry has a direct, high-level role in Angola's overarching cybersecurity governance or policymaking. Current cybersecurity initiatives are led by entities such as the Ministry of Telecommunications, Information Technologies, and Social Communication, which are spearheading legislative efforts and public consultations on cybersecurity[3].

The energy sector inherently involves critical infrastructure that must be protected from cyber threats, as highlighted by regional organizations such as OLADE which emphasize cybersecurity for energy generation, transmission, and distribution systems[6]. Ecuador's national cybersecurity strategy and CSIRT efforts are led primarily by the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Society, indicating central governmental cybersecurity roles lie there[2][5]. However, given the crucial importance of protecting energy infrastructure and the need for sector-specific cybersecurity measures, it is reasonable to consider Ecuador's Ministry of Energy a stakeholder with at least a moderate level of cybersecurity involvement\u2014specifically in protecting energy systems and critical infrastructure. This aligns with typical international practices where energy ministries coordinate with cybersecurity authorities on sector-specific protections[4][6].

However, the direct responsibility for national cybersecurity operations and incident management resides primarily with the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) under the Prime Minister's office, as well as other central bodies like SGDSN, not the Ministry of Energy itself. The Ministry is a key stakeholder because energy is considered critical infrastructure and operators under its remit must follow cybersecurity directives issued or coordinated at the national level, but it does not appear to have the frontline role in cybersecurity incident response or enforcement. Thus, the Ministry has a medium-level involvement as a policy and oversight stakeholder, collaborating with ANSSI and the national security apparatus that centrally manages cybersecurity strategy for critical infrastructure[1][2][5]. The energy sector operators themselves must implement cybersecurity measures and liaise with agencies such as ANSSI, but direct cybersecurity operational responsibility is centralized outside the Ministry of Energy[1][2].

The energy sector's cybersecurity protections and incident management procedures are coordinated with national authorities, indicating involvement in cybersecurity at a strategic and operational level although direct responsibility for national cybersecurity policy and regulation lies with the CNCS and related central government entities. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy is a cybersecurity stakeholder due to its role in managing critical infrastructure cybersecurity preparedness and incident reporting, but the primary cybersecurity regulatory and strategic authority is elsewhere in the government.[3][4][5]"},"parsing_success":true,"parsing_error":null,"retries_used":0}

The energy sector, including electricity supply, is one of the critical infrastructure sectors that are subject to cybersecurity measures under the NIS Directive and its successor, NIS 2, which emphasizes the security of network and information systems in designated sectors like energy[1][2]. While the responsibility for cybersecurity is generally overseen by other authorities, such as the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and CERT-SE for incident response, the energy sector's critical nature means that it is indirectly involved in cybersecurity through sector-specific regulations and preparedness measures, such as those handled by Svenska kraftn\u00e4t for ensuring the security of electricity supply[6]."},"parsing_success":true,"parsing_error":null,"retries_used":0}

However, given that the energy sector involves critical infrastructure typically relevant to cybersecurity, the Ministry of Energy might have an indirect interest or low-level involvement in protecting its sector, but no sources confirm direct responsibility or involvement in national cybersecurity efforts. Thus, the Ministry of Energy in the Syrian Arab Republic is likely a low-level or indirect stakeholder rather than a direct cybersecurity stakeholder."},"parsing_success":true,"parsing_error":null,"retries_used":0}

Uganda's National Cybersecurity Strategy and related documents highlight government commitments to protect critical infrastructure sectors such as power, which would fall under the Ministry of Energy's purview. However, formal assignments and direct responsibilities for cybersecurity often appear centralized in entities like the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance and the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC), which handle national cybersecurity policy and incident response. IT departments within ministries, including the Ministry of Energy, are responsible for internal IT security and incident handling, indicating involvement but not necessarily leading national cybersecurity efforts.
